# UnityScripts
My Unity C# script and package collection. Publicly available to serve for both a personal portfolio and backup.

If any script(s) are used in your project, it would be most appreciated if you gave credit in return.
If you wish to contact me for any reason, such as feedback or sharing your project you used my script in, please send it to my e-mail: github.kj1pq@slmails.com
