/*
 *  2D avatar script, by ScorpiusG.
 *  Manipulates the Sprite Renderer and Animator components based on avatar's facing direction and movement speed
 *  versus camera's rotation.
 *  
 *  The Animator should have the following float parameters: LookDirX, LookDirY, MoveSpd
 *  These values are manipulated by this script to handle look direction and check if movement is involved per frame.
 *  
 *  Set your Blend Trees to use LookDirX and LookDirY values, and have your directional animations play based on those values.
 *  If you don't know what Blend Trees are, please look up tutorials or videos on YouTube for this.
 *  If some your sprites are only facing on one side and not the other (in this case, the right side),
 *  you can set Flip Sprite Based On Look Direction to TRUE. This will toggle Flip X on the Sprite Renderer
 *  when the avatar is facing the left side. Adjust the Flip Sprite Look X Direction Threshold value to determine
 *  the X-direction value before flipping the sprite.
 *  
 *  You can set Auto Set Look Dir Based On Position Delta to TRUE and it will do all the work for you.
 *  If you want to do it manually, set it to FALSE instead and call these methods from another script:
 *  public void SetLookDirection(Vector2 value)
 *  public void SetMovementSpeed(float speed)
 *  
 *  These methods also exist if you want to toggle look direction/move speed automation or get the look direction respectively:
 *  public void SetAutoLookState(bool state)
 *  public Vector3 GetLookDirection()
